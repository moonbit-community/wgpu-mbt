# Project Agents.md Guide

This is a [MoonBit](https://docs.moonbitlang.com) project.

## Project Structure

- MoonBit packages are organized per directory, for each directory, there is a
  `moon.pkg.json` file listing its dependencies. Each package has its files and
  blackbox test files (common, ending in `_test.mbt`) and whitebox test files
  (ending in `_wbtest.mbt`).

- In the toplevel directory, this is a `moon.mod.json` file listing about the
  module and some meta information.

## Coding convention

- MoonBit code is organized in block style, each block is separated by `///|`,
  the order of each block is irrelevant. In some refactorings, you can process
  block by block independently.

- Try to keep deprecated blocks in file called `deprecated.mbt` in each
  directory.

## Tooling

- `moon fmt` is used to format your code properly.

- `moon info` is used to update the generated interface of the package, each
  package has a generated interface file `.mbti`, it is a brief formal
  description of the package. If nothing in `.mbti` changes, this means your
  change does not bring the visible changes to the external package users, it is
  typically a safe refactoring.

- In the last step, run `moon info && moon fmt` to update the interface and
  format the code. Check the diffs of `.mbti` file to see if the changes are
  expected.

- Run `moon test` to check the test is passed. MoonBit supports snapshot
  testing, so when your changes indeed change the behavior of the code, you
  should run `moon test --update` to update the snapshot.

- You can run `moon check` to check the code is linted correctly.

- When writing tests, you are encouraged to use `inspect` and run
  `moon test --update` to update the snapshots, only use assertions like
  `assert_eq` when you are in some loops where each snapshot may vary. You can
  use `moon coverage analyze > uncovered.log` to see which parts of your code
  are not covered by tests.

- agent-todo.md has some small tasks that are easy for AI to pick up, agent is
  welcome to finish the tasks and check the box when you are done

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd sync
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
